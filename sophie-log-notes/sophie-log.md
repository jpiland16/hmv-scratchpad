- looking more into MVN software adn requested a free trial
  - According to the website the free trial comes with preloaded data to work with. I'm thinking if I export that data into Excel I can pull the quaternion values out of it and we can

- created simple THREE.js scene with stiff model made of cubes in an attempt to get the BACK IMU data displayed correctly
- oriented the camera so THREE.js coord system matches OPPORTUNITY coord system:
```
camera.position.x=5
camera.rotation.y=MATH.PI/2
camera.rotation.z=MATH.PI/2
```
 - With the rotation of the camera, I don't think any further adjustments will need to be made to the OPPORTUNITY quaternions to adjust for difference between THREE coord sys and global OPPORTUNITY coord sys

 - Technique for orienting block person correctly using OPP data:
    - take vector v=(-1,0,0) (the vector that should be pointing upwards along the spine in the sensor space) and apply OPP quaternion (normalized)
    - now v should be transformed from the sensor coord sys to the global OPPORTUNITY coord sys
    - use `blockPerson.pointAt(v)` and the local upwards vector of the blockPerson(the spine) should be in line with v and thus be in the correct orientation
 - Issues with current technique:
    - Doesn't take into account the rotation of the blockperson around the spine
      - Needs to have a similar function where vector v=(0,0,1) is transformed by the OPP quaternion and the face (front facing vector of the block person) is aligned to this vector
      - [WebGL2 : 136 : Quaternion Swing and Twist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hc2eHJUOEBE) (not sure if this video link would help me to do that)
    - Not sure that the spine is correctly oriented at the moment
      - Can I assume that the sensors x axis ligns up perfectly with the back? Probably not
      - Does q0=q1, q1=q2, q2=q3, q3=q4 or q1=q1, q2=q2, q3=q3, q4=q0?
