#### promises about what we will do until around 7/15/2021:

jonathan:
- upload opportunity dataset
- calibration form
- preprocessing
- going back home from the visualizer page

sophie:
- try to get the split screen figures rendering using the same data twice
- working on the new, walking dataset
- a page which links back to the original dataset sources
- make an app bar that links back

sam:
- pre load the model when viewport loads in
- mess around to get lab working once we pre load the model (bypassing the stages)
- progress reports showing on the loading screen
- playbar

#### Random notes and to-do list items
- Viewing two files requires some joint playbar component. It is just a container for two of them with a global play button that stops when one runs out of values
- occasionally the file list request takes a long time. the fix is to put a loading indicator
- caching the model by making it load when the viewport mounts
- making the progress get shown to the user
- add a camera reset button
- add an app bar
