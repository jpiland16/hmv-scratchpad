#### File security
- we have the following requirements:
  1. prevent users from seeing/fetching each others' files
  2. prevent server from seeing the content of anybody's files (after processing)

- one fix: token generation like in tokengen branch
  - deals with (1)
- another idea: use a password (provided by user) as the 'key' for encrypting everything
  - used for encrypting pdfs
  - need to use a hash as the actual encryption key
  - deals with (2). deals with (1) if we also prevent notifying users about the existence of files they can't decrypt

#### Storing files locally on the server
- right now, folder names are determined by UNIX time.
  - what if people submit at the exact same time? make sure there's a random element AND check for overlap (see keygen)

#### promises about what we will do until around 7/8/2021:
- jonathan will look at security methods d=and at my branch
- sophie will finish writing the tutorial, look at firebase authentication, and work with rabih's xml data
- sam will make a pull request to master. clean up and document and JSDoc comment code. answer questions from jonathan. look at sophie's tutorial
