meeting notes 8-5-2021:
- what have we worked on so far?
	- html page for explanation of the code

- to do:
	- debug uploading: why doesn't uploading work?
	- upload form: ensure that the user doesn't put multiple sensors on the same bone
		- either (1) disable submit button when things are invalid or (2) remove already-selected sensors from the drop-down list
	- finishing up all of the documentation links from the TOC
	- add legs to upload form
	- change links in documentation TOC to have 'blob' instead of 'edit' so that you go to viewing
	- add credit to anybody whose code we are using, to the README

- promises:
	- sophie:
		- get that second upload screen working, for in-depth local transforms
		- work on documentation
			- main menu panels, ui stuff, viewport
		- add legs to upload screen
		- make sure people don't submit the same sensor twice (same limb)
	- sam:
		- add hip movement
		- add more examples for gait dataset	
		- add some examples for daily+exercise dataset
		- debug the upload form server-side. why can't i upload properly?
		- work on documentation:
			- serverside processing
			- make the github issue to track it
  - jonathan:
    - smartphone dataset
    - documentation
    - probably more promises, but he had to leave a few minutes early so I'm not sure
