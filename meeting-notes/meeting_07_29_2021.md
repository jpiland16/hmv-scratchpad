notes from meeting 7/29/2021
- front end changes:
	- visualizer object exists now
	- discovering new JSDoc things: specifying prop types, specifying object types
	
- what do we do about the model pivoting about the ground when it bends its back?
	- we can make the hip bone the parent of the legs and back, instead of having the root be the parent
	- name of hip joint: mixamorig:Hips_01 will now map to HIPS
- antoher option for moving files to remote machine: use SCP (secure copy protocol) to move files over, and then use mv as described
	- is there a better way?
- put a couple buttons up on the top to do front view, side view, etc. in case user screws up their orientation
	- we want a reset button for resetting view, and this might depend on the visualizer
