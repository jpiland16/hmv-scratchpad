## promises about what we will work on:
- sophie:
	- add css and better format to upload form, if time permits

- jonathan:
	- work on visualizer object refactor
	- then, maybe, adding the visualizer to the calibration form
	- look at smartphone dataset

- sam:
    - work on gait dataset: hopefully get an example on the website
    - maybe refactor netops, merge refactoring of bone ops from 'viewport_workers' branch


## assumptions about the input data:
- there is a column with the time in millis (but we can ask for sample rate instead)
- all columns are in one file (so not horizontal appending)
- if a limb doesn't have data, it should not move

## low-priority features that we would like:- 
- add symmetrical movement for bones that don't have data; OR gracefully hide bones without data
- descriptions for files that are visible when you mouse over/select them
- uploading multiple files and horizontally append them (as if it was one big file with more columns)
- uploading multiple files and process them all by the same schema
objective this week: enjoy vacation/summer in general
