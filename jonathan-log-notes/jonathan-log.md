## 7/27/2021

I've been working on the `MannequinVisualizer` class to make it usable in the site. The first step was to implement a very similar algorithm to what we were already doing (see [this commit](https://github.com/jpiland16/hmv_test/commit/24cee540b1114dfce91c8d7d319aef6dba22f75f)).

The next steps I took were as follows:
 - Implement a recursive tree traversal in several places to simplify the code and to prepare for doing fewer calculations along the lines of `getLocalFromGlobal` ([this commit](https://github.com/jpiland16/hmv_test/commit/1514005dcedfbec14cb51653fe8d11f6ff5b0205)).
 - Make `BasicVisualizerObject` even more generalized to accomodate for more types of visualizers, and create a new class called `ThreeJsVisualizer` ([this commit](https://github.com/jpiland16/hmv_test/commit/10c8f4d36bf0d22f847bcdc16afac753b8a48f98)).
 - Simplify calculations using the tree traversal ([this commit](https://github.com/jpiland16/hmv_test/commit/c58f3818acf6682b7b8ab59f6ea7cc78a79e72fa))
 - Remove unused code
 - Merge master into my branch


## 7/25/2021

I hadn't been making a ton of notes for a while, since most of my recent work has been UI improvements such as logos and title bars as well as testing some labs, but some of my recent updates are given below.

 - Create a logo and incorporate it into the title bar
 - Test token generation to keep user files private
 - Test using the leg data to prevent the entire model from leaning
   - Incorporate position modifications to keep the model in the center of the screen
 - Merge Sam's pull request to implement socket.io

There are still some outstanding changes that need to be made, including:
 - Recursive folder validation
 - Disallowing clicking of multiple files repeatedly, or stopping the loading of previously clicked files
 - Implement LTQ as part of the upload form

Soon, I would like to accomplish the following:
 - [x] Implement a global flag to disable `console.log` in the browser
 - [ ] Make it so that the GTQ is pre-applied whenever a dataset is uploaded to the server, to save computation time
 - [ ] Get the sliders working again
 - [x] Get the Visualizer object working as well as the current visualizer
 - [ ] Get labs working
 - [ ] Implement user privacy for file uploads
 - [ ] Possibly work on split screen
 - [ ] Create documentation
 - [ ] Make it so that the same DatatypeHandlers we apply to uploaded files can be run against the existing Opportunity files

## 6/15/2021

 - Incorporate leg data (symmetric / out of phase ?) (priority)
 - Walk around the room (?)

 NOTES:
  - Should secure it (?)
  - Domain name OK
  - How to protect it from breaking (user uploads, privacy)

 NEXT:
  - Look at other datasets

## 6/10/2021

 - TODO:
   - [ ] Disable OK button while file is uploading
   - [ ] Add progress bar
 - Below

## 6/9/2021

 - Looking at abstracting the hard-coded column numbers and transformations for the opportunity dataset so that we can use the site for multiple datasets. Making a list of places where code might need to be abstracted:
   - *Viewport.js*
     - [ ] `onLoadBones` (setParents) (?) line 260
   - *Animator.js*
     - [ ] `props.outputTypes.current` line 35
     - [x] `if (i <= 1) ...` (identity rotations) line 47
     - [x] `targetQ.premultiply` (rotate body to stand upright) line 63
   - *CardItem.js* (last priority)
     - In general, there is a lot of hard-coded data that deals with the Opportunity Dataset. Might need to pull some of the values out into paramters.

## 6/8/2021

 - Over the past week, made several improvements to the site:
   - Added upload functionality to server
   - Added file viewing using Sophie's quaternions
   - Cleaned up the settings page
   - Divided site into a default mode and development mode
   - Added a setting for displaying time in MM:SS.mmm rather than just milliseconds
   - Changed the default settings for time display and cards display

## 6/2/2021

 - Regarding yesterday's success, it looks like I just got a bit lucky by trying random numbers, since my equations were not correct. [Sophie's method](https://github.com/jpiland16/hmv_test/blob/4cde132f42a589eb0fb9e6db79342e9f1918cf47/src/components/menu/components/main-panel/subpanels/Labs/Sophie20210530/test1.js#L111-L131) defintely looks to be the most correct, and it has sound logic behind it.

## 5/31/2021

 - Made the assumption that there were a limited (24) number of initial positions for the back - 8 along each axis. Found quaternions for each orientation and stored them in an array, as shown below. (The colored numbers correspond to array indices.) 

 <img src="./bodyRotations.png">

 > Note: When describing orientation in three dimensions, quaternions are unique *up to sign*. So (0, 0, 0, 1) = (0, 0, 0, -1).

 - The tests conducted on [5/29](#5292021) thus corresponded to the following quaternions:
   - Test 1: #9
   - Test 2: N/A
   - Test 3: #14
   - Test 4: #17
 - For the tests conducted on [5/30](#5302021):
   - Test 1: #23
   - Test 2: #21

 - When using the lab (titled _Jonathan 5/27/2021_) to check through all 24 possible initial orientations, #5 and #15 looked the best, except for the fact that the sitting and laying down motions still looked sideways. So I added an optional (enabled by default) 90&deg; CCW rotation of the body about the vertical axis, and this seemed to make the motions look correct.

   - TODO: 
     - [ ] figure out why this worked
     - [ ] figure out if either #5 or #15 is the correct initialization quaternion (or neither)
     - [ ] apply whatever reasoning comes out of the above into the other joints (maybe)

 - Added a webhook to GitHub so that `push` events automatically trigger a website rebuild (`git pull` then `npm run build`) on our web server
     
## 5/30/2021

 - At this point, just trying some random adjustments to see if anything looks right.
   - Test 1: (-0.5, -0.5, 0.5, 0.5) = Chest in YZ facing -X, head in -Z. _Person seemed upside down, and the laying action looked wrong._
   - Test 2: (-0.5, 0.5, -0.5, 0.5) = Chest in YZ facing +X, head in -Z. _Person was primarily right-side-up as viewed from viewport. Still had the sit-lay-stand anomaly, though._
 - This started to get a bit tedious, and I was concerned about trying the same thing repeatedly or missing a possibility due to my lack of organization. Creating a lab module to address this problem... (see tomorrow's notes)


## 5/29/2021

 - Copied the opportunity dataset to the server
 - Tested out some of the transformations we discussed on Friday with the `S4-ADL4` file.
   
   **TEST 1**
    > Assumptions:
    >   1. We will use a coordinate system (West-Up-North) that is rotated 120&deg; CCW about the vector (1, 1, 1) relative to the Opportunity dataset coordinate system. 
    >   2. The Opportunity dataset is (X-Y-Z) = (North-West-Up).
    >      1. A default state (i.e. identity quaternion transformation) for the BACK based on sensor placement would have the frontal plane of the body in (opportunity) XY-plane, with the head pointed in the (opportunity) -x-direction.
    >      2. Since our coordinate system has been transformed, the above statement now becomes "...frontal plane of the body in XZ-plane, with the head pointed in the -z-direction." (i.e., we need to make the person "lean back" 90&deg; in the Three.js visualizer.)
    >
    >      This translated to the following code:
    >      ```js
    >      /* Transform our coordinate system */
    >      q.premultiply(new THREE.Quaternion(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5));
    >      q.multiply(new THREE.Quaternion(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, -0.5));
    >    
    >      /* Rotate the back to the correct initial position */
    >      q.premultiply(new THREE.Quaternion(-0.707, 0, 0, 0.707));
    >      ```
    > &nbsp;
    > Results: (all orientations described in Three.js coordinates unless otherwise noted)
    > 
    >   1. When the person was walking or standing, their head was generally pointed in the -x-direction and often spun about the x-axis. Supposing the floor was the YZ-plane, this could be plausible. When they laid down, the back was in XY with the head pointing in +Y. Again, with the sideways floor proposition this could be possible if the person was laying on their side. Check around the 40-second mark. (However, I'd like to think that I've made a mistake and the person was laying on their back. This is only an uneducated guess, however.) 
    >   2. The only real issues with the model appeared around 600 seconds when activitied labeled stand occasionally involved the model rotating with their head pointing in +Y. This observation is **not** compatible with the YZ-floor supposition.
    >   3. This is a bit of a reiteration from #1, but I really feel like the model needs to be rotated 90&deg; about the body's vertical axis. Meaning that laying down is back-down. This is influenced by the motion around 660 seconds where the sit-stand action looks a lot like a person leaning forward and then standing up (except that the visualizer showed a person leaning to the left and then standing up.)

    **TEST 2**

    > Same assumptions as Test 1 but tried reversing the order of the code just in case: 
    > ```js
    > /* Rotate the back to the correct initial position */
    > q.premultiply(new THREE.Quaternion(-0.707, 0, 0, 0.707));
    > 
    > /* Transform our coordinate system */
    > q.premultiply(new THREE.Quaternion(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5));
    > q.multiply(new THREE.Quaternion(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, -0.5));
    > ```
    > Results:
    > Failed miserably. Looked obviously wrong.

    **TEST 3**

    > Mostly the same assumptions as Test 1, except ignored the transformation mentioned in Assumption 2(II). So there was a differnent transformation, as shown below:
    > ```js
    > /* Transform our coordinate system */
    > q.premultiply(new THREE.Quaternion(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5));
    > q.multiply(new THREE.Quaternion(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, -0.5))
    > 
    > /* Rotate the back to the correct initial position */
    > q.premultiply(new THREE.Quaternion(0, 0, 0.707, 0.707));
    > ```
    > Results:
    > Again, seemed to be basically a failure. Interesting note, the person seemed to be upside down in this test.

    **TEST 4**

    > Again, mostly same assumptions as Test 1, except assume the sensors are (East-North-Up). So head needs to be pointed in (opportunity) -Y which is (Three.js) -X. Keeping frontal plane in XZ.
    >
    > ```js
    > /* Transform our coordinate system */
    > q.premultiply(new THREE.Quaternion(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5));
    > q.multiply(new THREE.Quaternion(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, -0.5));
    >  
    > /* Rotate the back to the correct initial position */
    > q.premultiply(new THREE.Quaternion(-0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5));
    > ```
    >
    > Results:
    > Extremely similar output to Test 1, except that this time the "floor" seemed to be the Three.js XY plane with the mannequin's head pointing out of the screen (+Z). Even with these assumptions the sitting/standing conundrum @660s and the laying while standing @600s still occured.


## 5/28/2021

 - During meeting, discussed how to apply transformations in order to correctly visualize the Opportunity quaternions. We are considering moving the camera as an alternative to applying some sort of change-of-basis transformation. 

 - Got the web server up and running on the virtual machine - it is available [here](http://vcm-20389.vm.duke.edu/). *Note: we are currently using the [hmv_test](github.com/jpiland16/hmv_test) repository; may consider switching to a new repository for collaboration.* 

   - Initially had some problems using `pm2` (process manager) but realized this was due to not using `sudo`. The correct commands are given below:
     - `sudo pm2 start server.js` starts our webserver if it is not already running
     - `sudo pm2 ls` list running processes
     - `sudo pm2 restart server` restarts the server
     - `sudo pm2 log` shows the log (`console.log`, `console.warn`, etc.)


## 5/27/2021 

 - Improved the lab module format, primarily to address warnings found when running in development build. 
   - Made it possible to utilize the development build for Three.js testing by including an `if` statement that pulls the files from the internet if the address in the browser is `localhost:3000` (the default when using `npm start`.)


 ## 5/26/2021 

  - Update to yesterday's log: I've decided it is going to be easier just to show on the screen which activity is occuring, since that is a part of the dataset.

    - I have plans to eventually develop a method to output this kind of data, such as graphs and text, to the screen.

  - Finished implementing a lab interface and wrote a [guide](https://github.com/jpiland16/hmv-scratchpad/blob/master/jonathan-lab-guide/hmv_test%EA%9E%89%20lab%20guidelines.md) on how to make a lab. 

## 5/25/2021 

 - Am looking into using some of the information provided int the label columns to help us get going. For example, using the MATLAB scripts to sort through the data quicker, I am going to try to use the following data from S4-ADL4.dat:

 |Start time (s)|Start line #|Locomotion     |
 |--------------|------------|---------------|
 | 40.733       | 1223       | Walking       |
 | 43.300       | 1300       | Standing      |
 | 44.166       | 1326       | Sitting       |
 | 46.600       | 1399       | Laying (down) |


## 5/24/2021

 - I've been testing some ideas for converting the Opportunity dataset quaternions into a usable format, based on the the information about sensor placement on the arms.

 - **Main idea**: I was thinking that, before applying an "Opportunity quaternion" to a part of our model, we should apply a transformation that makes a supposed "sensor" on the arm would have the orientation corresponding to an identity quaternion value [(XYZW) = (0, 0, 0, 1)]. Then perhaps we would need to apply a transformation to rotate the coordinate system, since the ENU system has the +z-axis pointing "up" while Three.js has the +z-axis pointing out of the screen. I tried applying these quaternions based on [Sam's notes](https://github.com/jpiland16/hmv-scratchpad/blob/master/sam-log-notes/sam-log.md#5232021) from 5/23/2021.  *Retrospectively, I'm not sure if any of this worked or was even correct, because the model still looked fairly unusual.*

   - What I tried:
     
     RUA, RLA needed to be oriented so the back of the hand faced the front of the screen (+Z) and so that the hand pointed toward +X (right side of screen)

      - Premultiplied `(XYZW) = ( sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2, 0, 0 )` before opportunity quaternion

     LUA, LLA needed to be oriented in the same manner:

      - Premultiplied `(XYZW) = ( -sqrt(2)/2, -sqrt(2)/2, 0, 0 )` before opportunity quaternion

     BACK needed to be oriented such that the spine pointed to left of screen with right shoulder pointing up

      - Premultiplied `(XYZW) = ( 0, 0, sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2 )` before opportunity quaternion

    Then post-multiplied this new quaternion by `(XYZW) = (0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5)` in an attempt to rotate the coordinate axes 120&deg; CCW about the unit vector parallel to `(XYZ) = (1, 1, 1)`.
    
 This still did not work, as the mannequin's arms were intersecting its body and moving in unusual ways. The test data I used (first 720 lines of S4-ADL4.dat) appear to start with a walking rhythm - but I wasn't able to simulate the walking motion with any sets of quaternions I tried.


## 5/23/2021

 - Made some progress on implementing Sam's cone test.
 - Improved the slider so that it keeps moving when you change menu tabs and still pauses at the end if repeat is disabled.
    - This improved slider will probably appear in the viewport on our next iteration
 - Started developing a different test including some of the Opportunity data but could not seem to get the quaternions to provide a useful visual representation
